# MMD File viewer

This plugin opens mermaid's `.mmd` files in Obsidian.
Install and activate the plugin.
When you open a `.mmd` file stored in your vault, it will render the diagram.
It uses [svg-pan-zoom](https://github.com/bumbu/svg-pan-zoom) for mouse scroll, double-click and pan interactions on the rendered diagram.
